                    <h3>Behaviour Therapy</h3>
                    Behaviour therapy involves preventing the response, for
                    example washing your hands or burshing your teeth, and 
                    graded exposure. That is, the more a compulsion is 
                    resisted, the easier it becomes to resist next time,
                    however, the more you give in to a compulsion makes
                    it harder to resist.
                    For some, resisting compulsions might be easy, and
                    for others it might be very difficult. Behaviour
                    therapy can be daunting at first so seek help
                    from a physcologist or a physicatrist if you 
                    need it.
                    Steps on behaviour therapy can be found on this website:

                    <h3>Medication</h3>
                    Treating OCD with medications involves the use 
                    of Serotonin Specific Re-uptake Inhibitors (SSRIs).
                    For most who have tried using medication to treat 
                    their OCD, they find that their complusions are still 
                    there, but are less frequent and less severe. However, it 
                    should be noted that the effectiveness of using medication 
                    for OCD varys from person to person. Studies show 50% 
                    of people who used medication have seen an improvement 
                    in symptoms, compared to 70% for behaviour therapy.
