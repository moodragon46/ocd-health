                <br>

                <p>
                    OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is a type of anxiety disorder. This disorder causes
                    recurring anxious thoughts that can become obsessive. These thoughts can be things
                    such as, 'Are my hands clean?' or 'Did I lock the door?'. A person with OCD will 
                    compulsively act to try and neutralise their obsessive thoughts. For example, if a 
                    person with OCD is afraid that someone will break into their house, they will repeatedly
                    check that their front door is locked. The fear of robbery and to double check 
                    the door is normal, but when it becomes obsessive (as in checking the door
                    numerous times before leaving), it begins to become a problem
                    that interupts day to day life.
                    <br>
                    In Australia, up to 3% of people will experience OCD in their lifetime, and
                    up to 2% in a 12 month period. It can happen to anyone during any point
                    in their lives, and even young children may show symptoms. However,
                    in younger children it doesn't fully develop until they are older.
                    <br>
                    OCD victims often feel shamed when they carry out compulsive actions as they feel they could be
                    socially unaccepted. As they feel shamed, it can lead to the person not getting help as early as
                    they should.
