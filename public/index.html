            <p>
                OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is a type of anxiety disorder. This disorder causes
                recurring anxious thoughts that can become obsessive. A person with OCD will compulsively act to
                try and neutralise their obsessive thoughts.
                <br>
                OCD victims often feel shamed when they carry out compulsive actions as they feel they could be
                socially unaccepted. As they feel shamed, it can lead to the person not getting help as early as
                they should.
