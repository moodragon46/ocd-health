                <p>
                    OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) is a type of anxiety disorder. This disorder causes
                    recurring anxious thoughts that can become obsessive. A person with OCD will compulsively act to
                    try and neutralise their obsessive thoughts.
                    <br>
                    OCD victims often feel shamed when they carry out compulsive actions as they feel they could be
                    socially unaccepted. As they feel shamed, it can lead to the person not getting help as early as
                    they should.
